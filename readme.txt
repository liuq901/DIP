Dear Prof Lu,

I choose problem 1~5, 7~9 as my project. You can find the details in the corresponding folder.
For every folder, there are three sub-folders: code, data and report.
report: It contains the PDF format report for every problem. The report was generated by LaTeX, the LaTeX source code can also be found is the same directory.
data: It contains all the images including input and output. Due to LaTeX does not support TIFF format, I converted all the images with TIFF format to JPEG format.
code: It contains the Python source code. I use package 'Image' to deal I/O, 'matplotlib' to plot diagrams, 'scipy' and 'numpy' to do FFT and DCT.
If you have any questions about my assignment, please contact me via e-mail at liuq901@163.com.

Thanks
